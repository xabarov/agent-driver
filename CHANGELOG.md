# Changelog

All notable changes to `agent-driver` are recorded here. Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); the project is pre-1.0 (`0.x`),
so the public surface (see [docs/embedding.md](docs/embedding.md)) may still
change between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added — real PDF text extraction for hard Deep Research
- `pdf_read` now extracts page-aware text from fetched PDFs via the optional
  `[pdf]` extra (pypdf) instead of only echoing injected mock text. Outcomes are
  explicit: real extraction → `status="verified"` with per-page `page_citations`
  and `total_pages`; extractor not installed → `text_extraction_unavailable`;
  scanned/image-only PDF → `no_extractable_text`; malformed structure past the
  magic-byte check → `pdf_parse_failed`. Non-verified outcomes keep
  `verified_text=False` so they are never treated as verified evidence. Core
  stays dependency-light — absent the extra, behaviour degrades gracefully.

### Added — reliable tool-first workflow nodes (`NodeContract`)
- Opt-in `AgentRunInput.node_contract` runtime enforcement for harness/workflow
  nodes (see [docs/node-contract.md](docs/node-contract.md)):
  - **Layer A** (`require_callable_tools`): run-start policy↔registry validation;
    uncallable `allowed_tools` / `finalize_when_tools` surface a
    `node_contract_warning` event + `output.metadata["node_contract"]
    ["tool_policy_warnings"]` instead of being silently dropped.
  - **Layer B** (`require_tool_use`): proactive tool-use prelude (tools + target)
    woven into the system prompt, plus a reactive guard that reprompts a
    zero-tool-call finalize (`max_tool_use_reprompts`) and then stamps a typed
    `no_tool_use` violation rather than returning a silent generic answer.
  - **Layer C** (`finalize_when_tools` + the `on_tool_evidence` lifecycle hook):
    finalize directly from sufficient tool evidence with no extra LLM
    continuation; terminal answer + tool outputs preserved.
- `RunLifecycleHook.on_tool_evidence(context, envelopes) -> FinalizeNow | None`
  escape hatch (`stop_after_tool_evidence` / `finalize_when_tools_satisfy_contract`).
- `tool_call_completed` event rows now carry `output_preview` + `structured_output`
  for downstream normalization.

### Added — cross-harness capabilities (E1–E8 + T0)
- Auxiliary cheap-model routing for side tasks (`RunnerConfig.auxiliary_provider`
  / `auxiliary_model`); compaction spend separated by model in the cost ledger.
- Tool-call argument truncation pre-pass before compaction
  (`enable_tool_arg_truncation`).
- Project-memory files (AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md) layered into the system prompt
  (`project_memory_sources`), scanned for prompt-injection at ingestion.
- Ingestion injection/C2 scanner (`agent_driver.security.scan_context_text`),
  wired into project memory, skills, and recalled long-term memory.
- Configurable tool concurrency (`tool_concurrency_limit`).
- Per-subagent-type model routing (`subagent_model_routing`).
- Message sanitization (lone-surrogate / NUL stripping) before provider calls.
- Anthropic prompt-cache breakpoints (tools → system → conversation)
  (`enable_prompt_cache`).
- Declarative harness profiles (per-model prompt slots / tool exclusion /
  description overrides).
- Pluggable filesystem backends (`agent_driver.fs`): `FileBackend` protocol,
  `StateBackend`, `LocalFilesystemBackend`, `CompositeBackend`.
- Low-budget evaluation harness (`agent_driver.evals`): N-run aggregation,
  baseline-vs-treatment comparison, open-weight presets, `general_task_suite`,
  and the `agent-driver eval compare` CLI.

### Added — subagents & governance
- In-process background subagents (`AsyncSubagentManager` / `BackgroundSubagent`):
  start / check / cancel by task id.
- Scope-aware human-in-the-loop predicate (`PermissionRule.path_under`): approve
  only when a bulk/glob op could touch a protected path.

### Added — SDK & library readiness
- Grouped capability config (`CapabilitySettings`) with backward-compatible flat
  `RunnerConfig` kwargs.
- Construction-time default `tool_gate` on `create_agent` (no per-call threading).
- PEP 561 `py.typed` marker; documented public embedding surface
  ([docs/embedding.md](docs/embedding.md)).

### Changed
- `BatchRunner` retries transient failures (rate-limit/429, overload, timeout,
  server, transport) with backoff and fails fast on non-transient ones
  (auth, billing/402, model-not-found, content-policy, context-overflow).
- OpenRouter open-weight list prices registered in the cost ledger.

## [0.1.0]

Initial baseline: durable single-agent runtime (step loop, checkpoints, event
log, replay, resume, interrupts), context management (trimming / compaction /
token pressure), governed tools (manifests, policy, guardrails, gate),
permissions, planning & steering, subagents, long-term memory, lifecycle hooks,
providers (fake / OpenAI-compatible / Ollama / Anthropic) with descriptors,
router and error classification, cost ledger, scheduler, gateway core, batch
trajectories, MCP server, and the SDK facade.
